## Biometric Data Analysis

Performix is  award winning software package that enables you to monitor and manage the performance of your biometric solution.

Performix simplifies your data into powerful analysis reports and provides interactive data visualisation with the ability to fully drill-down into the data. This provides reporting and inquiry capabilities that go well beyond what you would expect in a conventional Management Information System.  Performix provides for a range of enterprise level capabilities, including:

### Features

*	Data reporting and analysis. Provides investigative insights through regular or ad-hoc management reports. Data can be displayed and interrogated via a large number of completely configurable visualisations.

*	Dashboarding and alerting. Real-time dashboard and predictive alerting facilitating timely management and decision making and Service Level Agreement management.

*	Fusion and data-mining (and vulnerability detection). Statistical analysis of data to identify outlier vulnerabilities in performance. One of the advantages of Performix is that it allows users to drill down to the absolute extent of data holdings to identify root causes of an issue.  This can be done live on screen with the click of mouse button.

*	Collaboration. Inbuilt social features allow collaboration between investigators as well as external client reporting.

*	Enterprise level integration. Proven integration with enterprise systems and data stores.

*	Machine Learning. Connection to machine learning systems to model system activity, identify anomalous behaviour and analyse unstructured data.

*	Outlier Identification. Determine outliers inside complex multidimensional data sets. Undertake root cause analysis on those outliers to allow an operator to quickly identify which outliers are problems that require investigation.

*	Visualisation. Provide a range of 2D and 3D visualisations allow data to be explored interactively (including using a VR headset). Visualisations are carefully tailored to ensure that they present optimum relevant information.

###	How is Performix Built

Performix is a ‘built for biometrics’ data analytics and performance reporting solution. At its core, Performix uses a strong statistical analysis capability enhanced through the use of machine learning and predictive analytics. This engine enables the rapid analysis of extremely large volumes of biometric data through the use of a patent pending algorithm and advanced data pre-caching.
